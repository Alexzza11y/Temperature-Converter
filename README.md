# Temperature Converter (Java Swing)

A simple and intuitive desktop application built with Java Swing that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This project demonstrates core Java concepts, including GUI development, event handling, and input validation.

## Features
- **Bi-directional Conversion**: Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
- **Real-time Selection**: Choose the target unit using radio buttons.
- **Input Validation**: Handles non-numeric inputs gracefully without crashing, providing user feedback.
- **Formatted Output**: Displays results rounded to one decimal place for better readability.

## Technologies Used
- **Java SE**: Core logic and object-oriented structure.
- **Java Swing**: Graphical user interface components (`JFrame`, `JButton`, `JRadioButton`, `JTextField`).
- **Lambda Expressions**: Used for concise and modern event handling.
